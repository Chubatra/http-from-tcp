The sky shifted from a soft amber to a deep violet as the sun dipped behind the hills,
casting long shadows across the quiet meadow. A gentle breeze rustled through the tall grass,
carrying with it the earthy scent of late summer and the distant chirp of crickets warming up for their nightly symphony. Somewhere nearby,
the lazy buzz of a bee drifted past,
weaving between wildflowers that had managed to hold onto their color despite the creeping chill. It was the kind of evening that made time feel slower,
like the world had paused just long enough to breathe.
